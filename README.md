# hello-world
This is my first repository, where I will store info about every project being hosted here

My name is Guilherme, I am currently a 40 years old brazilian with some engineering background who is looking for a carreer change to programming/developing. 
Although I have some low level programming experience (mostly with C language), I have never programmed for web and/or used any high level programming language
This repository will start as a learning tool and a journey tracker of my attempt to learn and gain experience with software development

For now, I will start with some projects with basic web and mobile development (HTML, CSS and Javascript) following some free trainings from places like Codeworks and Trybe
Later, I intend to add new projects with other languages (maybe Python, Java, Go?) and also other software development fields (data science, machine learning, etc).
